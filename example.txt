Simplicity is a key,
To a life of clarity and ease.
Through less, we gain more,
And in the minimal, beauty sore.

By sharing poems, full of light,
Thoughts and words that are bright.
Simple truths, with a deep impact,
Brend a world, that's infact.

Be kind, share a smile,
A life of simplicity, is always worthwhile.
